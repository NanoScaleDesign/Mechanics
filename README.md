This is course material for the Mechanics course held at Kyushu University during Spring 2017.
This course is targeted towards Mechanical Engineering students who have already completed one year of General Mechanics.
Students learn through challenge-based active learning, utilising the course textbook with support from in-class discussion with peers and the teacher to learn how to do the challenges and achieve mastery of the subject.
