# Mechanics

This is course material for the Mechanics I and II courses held at Kyushu University during Spring and Summer quarters in 2018.
This course is targeted towards Mechanical Engineering students who have already completed one year of General Mechanics.
Students learn through challenge-based active learning, utilising the course textbook with support from in-class discussion with peers and the teacher to learn how to do the challenges and achieve mastery of the subject.

The latest version of the PDF for the spring-quarter course can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NanoScaleDesign/Mechanics/master/mechanics_I.pdf).

The course is still being developed and is work-in-progress.
