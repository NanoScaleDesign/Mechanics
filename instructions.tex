\section{This course}
This is the Spring 2017 \course course studied by \nensei-year undegraduate international students at Kyushu University.

\subsection{What you need to do}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Borrow the book ``Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics'', 6th edition, by Meriam and Kraige from the Kikan-kyoiku office in the centre-zone. The course will be based on that book and you will need to refer to it in class.
    \item Prepare a challenge-log in the form of a workbook or folder where you can clearly write the calculations you perform to solve each challenge. This will be used in the final assessment and will be occasionally reviewed by the teacher.
    \item Submit a weekly feedback form by \textbf{9am on Monday} before class at \url{https://goo.gl/forms/2PgFF0eqTOvbK0to2}.
    \item Please bring a wifi-capable internet device to class, as well as headphones if you need to access online components of the course during class. If you let me know in advance, I can lend computers and provide power extension cables for those who require them (limited number).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How this works}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This booklet forms part of an active-learning segment in the course. The learning is self-directed in contrast to the traditional lecture-style model.
    \item Learning is guided through solving a series of challenges combined with instant feedback about the correctness of your answer.
    \item Traditional lectures are replaced by discussion time. Here, you are encouraged to discuss any issues with your peers, teacher and any teaching assistants. You can also learn from explaining concepts to your peers.
    \item Discussion-time is from \disctime on \discdays at room \discroom.
    \item Peer discussion is encouraged, however, if you have help to solve a challenge, always make sure you do understand the details yourself. You will need to be able to do this in an exam environment. The questions on the exam will be similar in nature to the challenges. If you can do all of the challenges, you can get 100\% on the exam.
    \item Every challenge in the book typically contains a \textbf{Challenge} with suggested \textbf{Resources} which you are recommended to utilise in order to solve the challenge. \textbf{Solutions} will be given. Occasionally the teacher will provide extra \textbf{Comments} to help guide your thinking.
    \item For deep understanding, it is recommended to study the suggested resources beyond the minimum required to complete the challenge.
    \item The challenge document has many pages and is continuously being developed. Therefore it is advised to view the document on an electronic device rather than print it. The date on the front page denotes the version of the document. You will be notified when the document is updated.
    \item A target challenge will be set each week. This will set the pace of the course and define the examinable material. It's ok if you can't quite reach the target challenge for a given week, but you should be careful not to fall behind, since the date of the exam cannot be delayed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assessment}
In order to prove to outside parties that you have learned something from the course, we must perform summative assessments. Details will be released at a later date, but will include your answers to the challenges and a final exam, so be sure to keep a record showing how you calculated the answers to all the challenges.
