\subsection*{Challenge}
Solve Question 4/22.

The question states that an impulse is imparted ``over a negligibly short period of time'' which is a little confusing since impulse is the integration of force over time which becomes zero as time goes to zero. Instead, here you can consider that whatever the time is, the final product of Force and Time is \SI{10}{\newton\second}.

\subsection*{Solution}
\SI{4.7}{m/s}

\subsection*{Solutions}
You should obtain an algebraic expression for $v$ and $\dot{\theta}$. To check your expression, you can substitute the following values into the expression:
$m_0=$ \SI{1}{\kg},
$v_0=$ \SI{1000}{\meter\per\second},
$b=$ \SI{1.5}{\meter} and
$m=$ \SI{4}{\kg}, whereby you should obtain
$v=$ \SI{111}{\meter\per\second} and
$\dot{\theta}=$ \SI{222}{\radian\per\second}.
